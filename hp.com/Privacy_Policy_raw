These tools collect certain traffic information that your browser sends to a website, such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier, clickstream behavior (i.e., the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with HP websites or “powered by” websites) and product information. HP may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails and communications sent from HP and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. To learn more, read <a href='#11' class='udrline'>How HP uses automatic data collection tools</a>.</p><br/><p>HP also collects information from publicly or commercially available sources that it deems credible. Such information may include your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic/profile data. The information HP collects from its public or commercial sources may be used along with the information HP collects when you visit HP’s sites. For example, HP may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area.</p><br/><p>Where necessary, HP may also use information provided by you or your employer, together with information from publicly available and other online and offline sources, to conduct due diligence checks on business contacts as part of HP’s anti-corruption program.</p><br/><p>HP may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else.  For example, we may collect anonymous answers to surveys or aggregated information about how users use our websites, products or services.</p><br/></div>

					<h3 class="trigger">4. How we share your information</h3>
					<div class="target" id="4"><p>HP will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Statement. HP shares personal information in the following ways:</p><br/><p>HP retains service providers and suppliers to manage or support its business operations, provide professional services, deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist HP with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers may be located in the US or other overseas locations and include, for example, credit card processors, debt collectors, providers of customer support and live-help, marketing and communications, hosting and IT service providers, email service providers,  automated data processors, shipping agents, management and support of HP websites, order fulfillment and delivery. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential and secure the information received on behalf of HP and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for HP.</p><br/><p>From time to time, HP participates in marketing initiatives with other companies, including websites “powered by” another company on behalf of HP. As part of these initiatives, certain HP services and marketing communications may be delivered at the same time as those from other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both HP and the other companies participating in these initiatives. For example, you may receive marketing communications from HP and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies. If you choose to provide personal information only to HP, HP will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative. If you choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy of those companies, which may differ from HP’s policies and practices.</p><br/><p>HP may also transfer your personal information to other HP-owned business entities in the US and Worldwide. By accessing HP websites, registering for an account or service, or otherwise providing HP with your personal information, you consent to this transfer of your personal information throughout the global HP network of entities.</p><br/><p>Except as described in this Statement, HP will not share the personal information you provide to HP with non-HP third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity; (iv) enforce/protect the rights and properties of HP or its subsidiaries; or (v) protect the rights or personal safety of HP, our employees, and third parties on or using HP property when allowed and in line with the requirements of applicable law.</p><br/><p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, HP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is HP’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p><br/></div>

<a name='wb'></a><h3 class='bold'>Web beacons</h3><p>Some HP.com and third-party web pages, applications, and HTML-formatted email use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email, as well as to measure performance on hp.com, applications, and websites “powered by” another company on HP’s behalf. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Depending on the context, web beacons may also refer to content on a third-party server, and may be used by service providers to deliver relevant advertising to you.</p><br/><p>You may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider.</p><br/><br/><p>If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from HP as specified in <a class='udrline' href='#6'>Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences</a>, HP may automatically collect personal information about you.
